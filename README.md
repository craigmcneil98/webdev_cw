## Getting Started

In order to run this application, you'll need to ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- git
- npm
- Node.js

To get started using this application, choose any appropriate IDE (I used Visual Studio Code for this project) and run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Clone the repository**

   git clone https://github.com/craigmcneil98/webdev_cw.git

2. **Install required packages**

   npm install

3. **Start the local server**

Now that the server is up and running, you should be able to open any web browser and view the application by entering "127.0.0.1:3000" or "Localhost:3000" in to the address bar.
