        <h2>Welcome to Our Charity Shops</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Our hospice charity operates four shops, each offering a unique selection of items generously donated by our community. 
            While we do not sell these items online, we aim to provide a glimpse of what you might find in-store. Our dedicated volunteers 
            update the listings regularly to showcase the unique items available. All proceeds support our hospice services and community programs.
        </p>

            Thank you for supporting our mission. We invite you to visit our shops and discover the wonderful items we have in store.
